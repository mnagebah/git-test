    Commands related to a remote repository:
        git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git or git clone https://github.com/user-name/repository-name.git
        git push origin main

The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

    git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
    git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
    git status is read as git | status | (no destination).


    What are some of your favorite books, links, resources, for someone interested in getting started in front-end web development?

       A Book Apart series, especially the books on HTML5 (Jeremy Keith) and CSS3 (Dan Cederholm). Great primers and reference material.
       A List Apart is a bi-weekly web journal that Iâ€™d consider required reading for any web developer, newbie or experienced.
       Smashing Magazine is a pretty classic web resource.
       Hacker News is a consistent source of news articles and discussion.

   For any developers who also design, I regularly read:

       Beautiful Pixels for design trends in mobile and web apps.
       Sidebar is a new link blog where I discover a lot of design related gems.

   Finally for the audio inclined:
